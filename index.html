      <h1>Creep</h1>
      <p>When you were here before<br/>Couldn't look you in the eye<br/>You're just like an angel<br/>Your skin makes me cry<br/>You float like a feather<br/>In a beautiful world<br/>And I wish I was special<br/>You're so fuckin' special<br/></p>
      <p>But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo.<br/>What the hell am I doing here?<br/>I don't belong here.<br/></p>
      <p>I don't care if it hurts<br/>I want to have control<br/>I want a perfect body<br/>I want a perfect soul<br/>I want you to notice<br/>When I'm not around<br/>You're so fuckin' special<br/>I wish I was special<br/></p>
      <p>But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo.<br/>What the hell am I doing here?<br/>I don't belong here.<br/></p>
      <p>She's running out again,<br/>She's running out<br/>She's run run run run<br/>Whatever makes you happy<br/>Whatever you want<br/>You're so fuckin' special<br/>I wish I was special<br/></p>
      <p>But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo.<br/>What the hell am I doing here?<br/>I don't belong here.<br/></p>
