        <h1>Creep</h1>
        <p>When you were here before<br />
        Couldn't look you in the eye<br />
        You're just like an angel<br />
        Your skin makes me cry<br />
        <br />
        You float like a feather<br />
        In a beautiful world<br />
        And I wish I was special<br />
        You're so fuckin' special<br />
